# without-facemask-detection

In this project we need two library files to run the program 
  1.opencv
  2.winsound(note: winsound is already pre-installed libary file)
you will save python file at any name and xml file in the following name => haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml 
Then go main python file run the program to get the new window for without facemask detection

Thankyou!!!
